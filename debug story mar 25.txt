Was creating a checkin for Doug Grody, Doug changed his mind so Keith cancelled check in. Then did a quick sale for Doug Grody. Server halted when adding USB Used speakers. Keith input details but when clicking save the fields except the name. Keith hit cancel and couldnt find new item in product list. Keith then went on to check in Jeff Tucker without problem and when he continued with another quick sale for Doug thats when everything froze.
